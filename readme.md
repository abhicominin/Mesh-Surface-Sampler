# Mesh-Surface-Sampler

## About
- 🛠 Mesh Surface Sampler is a library for Three.js that allows you to sample points on the surface of any Three.js mesh object.
- 💻 It provides a simple and easy to use API for getting random or uniform samples on the surface of a mesh.
- 🎨 Can be useful for a variety of purposes such as creating particle effects, adding noise to a surface, or creating a point cloud representation of a mesh.
- 🔢 It also allows to set the seed of the random generator which can be useful in cases where repeatable randomness is required.
## Twist
- 📝 Added two Javascript Files:
  - 💫MultipleLines.js effect to create multiple lines on the mesh surface
  - 🎨ColouredPoints.js effect to create colored points on the mesh surface
- 🚀 Try both these effects by replacing with the script.js file in your project
- 🔧 Experiment with different settings to create unique visual effects on your mesh
- 💻 Enjoy the power of Three.js and Mesh Surface Sampler to create stunning visual effects on your meshes!
